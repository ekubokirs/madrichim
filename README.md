madrichim
=========
My project is an internal document management system for the Congregation Tikvat Jacob Beth Torah Madrichim Program.  The system manages all of the paperwork submitted regarding the teenage teaching assistants as monitered by the administrators.  Each teenager must apply and fill out two self evaluations per year as well as one exit evaluation upon leaving the program.  They are also evaluated by their assigned teacher twice per year and by the administrator at the start of the program.

The purpose of the system is to be able to track one student through the program more easily since paperwork is usually sorted by semester rather than by student and we would like to be able to see student growth over the five years that they are in the program.
